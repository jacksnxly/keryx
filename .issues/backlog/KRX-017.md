# Add timeout to Claude subprocess execution

## Problem
The Claude subprocess execution in `src/claude/subprocess.rs` has no timeout configured. If Claude hangs indefinitely, the program will hang forever. The `ClaudeError::Timeout` variant exists but is never used.

## Current Behavior
The code spawns a Claude subprocess and waits indefinitely for it to complete:
```rust
let output = Command::new("claude")
    .arg("-p")
    .arg(prompt)
    .output()
    .await
    .map_err(ClaudeError::SpawnFailed)?;
```

If Claude hangs (network issues, API problems, infinite loop), the user must forcefully kill the process.

## Expected Behavior
The subprocess should have a configurable timeout (e.g., 5 minutes by default). If the timeout is exceeded, return `ClaudeError::Timeout` with the duration.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run keryx when Claude API is unresponsive
2. Observe program hangs indefinitely
3. Must use Ctrl+C to terminate

**Environment:** All platforms

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Subprocess has a default timeout (e.g., 300 seconds)
- [ ] Timeout is configurable via CLI flag or environment variable
- [ ] `ClaudeError::Timeout` is returned when timeout exceeded
- [ ] Error message indicates the timeout duration
- [ ] Subprocess is properly terminated when timeout occurs

## Technical Notes
**File:** `src/claude/subprocess.rs:37-57`

**Recommended fix:**
```rust
use tokio::time::{timeout, Duration};

let output = timeout(
    Duration::from_secs(300),
    Command::new("claude")
        .arg("-p")
        .arg(prompt)
        .output()
).await
.map_err(|_| ClaudeError::Timeout(300))?
.map_err(ClaudeError::SpawnFailed)?;
```

**Dependencies:** None - `tokio::time::timeout` is already available.

**Related:** This was identified in the PR review as a critical issue that could cause production hangs.
